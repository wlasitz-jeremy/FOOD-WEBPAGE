What there is not to like about banana bread? Perfect for breakfast, afternoon snack, or evening dessert. Either way, always welcome in everyone’s homes. Here is my version of the banana bread with cranberries and white chocolate chips. Added a bit of fun to my classic recipe. Love with each bite.

This recipe makes two loaves. This is a great gift during the holidays. Use smaller molds and watch closely for the baking time. A great present always well received. Because the white chocolate melts in the baking process, this banana bread will take a little bit longer to bake than your usual one. As with each oven, the baking process may be different, I strongly suggest that you bake it for 45 minutes and then do the toothpick test in the middle of the bread to make sure it is baked all the way thru. Trust me here. The sides may be a bit darker but nothing worse than a loaf of non-baked banana bread.
