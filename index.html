    <h2>Preparation Instructions:</h2>
</header>
    <div>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350°</li>
                <li>With an electric beater, cream together sugar and butter until light and fluffy. Add bananas and eggs, beating until well mixed.</li>
                <li>Sift together dry ingredients three times. Blend with the bananas mixture but do not over mix. Fold in the vanilla, cranberries, and chocolate chips.</li>
                <li>Pour into 2 lightly-greased loaf pans. Bake for 45 minutes to one hour, until firm in the center and the edges begin to separate from pans. Do not over bake.</li>
                <li>Cool on a rack for 10 minutes before removing from pans. These freeze beautifully.</li>
