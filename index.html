Preperation Instructions:
-Preheat oven to 350°.
-With an electric beater, cream together sugar and butter until light and fluffy. Add bananas and eggs, beating until well-mixed.
-Sift together dry ingredients three times. Blend with the bananas mixture but do not over mix. Fold in the vanilla, cranberries, and chocolate chips.
-Pour into 2 lightly-greased loaf pans. Bake for 45 minutes to one hour, until firm in the center and the edges begin to separate from pans. Do not over bake.
-Cool on a rack for 10 minutes before removing from pans. These freeze beautifully.
