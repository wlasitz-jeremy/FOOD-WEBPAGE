-4 eggs well beaten

-2 1/2cups unbleached flour

-2 teaspoons baking soda

-1 teaspoon salt

-1 tablespoon vanilla

-1 cup dried cranberries

-1/2 cup white chocolate chips






Preperation Instructions:

-Preheat oven to 350°.

-With an electric beater, cream together sugar and butter until light and fluffy. Add bananas and eggs, beating until well-mixed.

-Sift together dry ingredients three times. Blend with the bananas mixture but do not over mix. Fold in the vanilla, cranberries, and chocolate chips.
